# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI refers to the interaction between Artificial Intelligence and the physical world. Unlike pure software AI, Physical AI involves sensors, actuators, and the real-world environment.

## What is Physical AI?
It is the bridge between the digital and physical realms. Think of robots, autonomous vehicles, and smart grids.

## Key Concepts
- **Sensors**: The eyes and ears of Physical AI.
- **Actuators**: The muscles that create movement or change.
- **Processing**: The brain that decides what to do.
